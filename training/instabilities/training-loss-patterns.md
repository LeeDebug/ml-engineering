## Introduction

Training large models like LLaMA-2 requires handling several challenges that can lead to unexpected behavior or issues. One of these is the occurrence of loss spikes, which can arise from various factors such as data resumption problems, repeat data in the dataset, and complex DataLoader configurations. This document aims to provide an overview of these challenges and how they might manifest during model training.

## Loss Spikes

Loss spikes are unexpected increases or sudden shifts in the training loss that do not necessarily indicate divergence (where the loss goes to infinity) but can still be problematic because they indicate a change in the data distribution being learned. These spikes can occur due to several reasons, including:

1. **Data Resumption Issues:**
   - When resuming training from a checkpoint after a crash or rollback, the model might not resume perfectly, leading to various problems such as changes in random number generation (RNG) states and DataLoaders' index positions.

2. **Repeat Data:**
   - If the same data is repeated multiple times during training, it can cause the model to overfit on that specific segment of the data, leading to false low loss values until it encounters new, unseen data. This situation can result in a sudden spike or shift to a higher loss level.

3. **Complex DataLoaders:**
   - DataLoaders with intricate configurations, such as those handling image-to-text ratios dynamically, might suffer from inconsistencies when resuming training. For instance, they may not correctly restore the state of the DataLoader, leading to data sampler issues that can cause loss spikes or shifts.

4. **Framework Handling of Resumes:**
   - Training frameworks like PyTorch Lightning (PTL) do not always handle resuming data samplers automatically without user intervention. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the same exact data sequence is repeated, causing the model to report false low losses until it encounters new data.

## Case Studies

### DataSampler Issues with IDEFICS-80B Training

During the training of a variation of LLaMA-2 for the IDEFICS-80B project, an unusual loss spike was observed. The initial training runs showed no significant increase in loss, but after resuming from a checkpoint and restarting, the model suddenly shifted to a higher loss level without diverging.

The key insight here is that the loss spikes were due to repeat data. Initially, the model overfit on the repeated segments of data, leading to falsely low reported losses. Once it encountered new, unseen data, the true loss levels started being reported, causing the spike and shift in loss values.

This problem was exacerbated by the fact that PyTorch Lightning's default behavior for resuming does not handle DataSampler states correctly, leading to potential issues if repeat data is present in the training dataset. To mitigate this, it is essential to ensure that the seed remains consistent across multiple runs or to implement custom logic to manage DataLoaders and samplers during resume.

### Handling Repeat Data in Training

To avoid the issues caused by repeat data, consider the following strategies:

1. **Use Unique Seeds:** Ensure that each training run uses a different random seed if possible. This can help mitigate overfitting on repeated data segments.
   
2. **Data Augmentation and Randomization:** Implement various forms of data augmentation to introduce variability in the training data, reducing the risk of overfitting on specific segments.

3. **Check Framework Documentation:** Verify that your training framework handles DataSampler resuming correctly. If it does not, consider implementing custom logic to manage the state of DataLoaders and samplers during resume.

4. **Early Resumes for Testing:** Perform a few early resumes with data reshuffling to detect any issues before embarking on extensive training. This can help identify problems such as overfitting or false loss reporting due to repeat data.

## Conclusion

Loss spikes during model training, while not always indicative of divergence, can indicate significant changes in the learning process that require attention. By understanding and addressing common causes like DataSampler issues, repeat data, and framework handling of resuming, you can ensure more stable and reliable training processes for large models such as LLaMA-2.

By adopting strategies to handle these challenges, you can reduce the likelihood of encountering unexpected behavior or false loss reports, leading to better model performance and reliability.
